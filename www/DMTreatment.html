        <h1>Dry Mouth</h1><br>
    </div>

            <h2>Diagnosing Dry Mouth</h2>

            <p class = "intro4">

       It is important to determine if dry mouth is caused by a change in salivary function and the severity of any salivary impairment. Dry mouth is diagnosed by both dentists and physicians.
            </p>
    <p class = "intro4">History </p>
            <p class = "text3">
                — Specifics of the complaint of dry mouth are obtained: duration, frequency, and severity. The presence of dryness at other sites (eyes, nose, throat, skin, vagina) is documented. A complete medical and prescription drug history is taken.
    </p>
    <p class = "intro4"> Examination </p>
            <p class = "text3">
                 — Major salivary glands are palpated for the presence of tenderness, firmness, or enlargement. The amount and quality of saliva coming from the ducts inside the mouth are assessed, and the absence of saliva or presence of dry or reddish oral mucosa is noted. Active dental decay is evaluated.
    </p>
    <p class = "intro4"> Salivary flow rate</p>
            <p class = "text3">
               — The amount of saliva produced during a specified amount of time may be measured. The test is non-invasive and painless.
    </p>
    <p class = "intro4">Scintigraphy</p>
            <p class = "text3">
                — Performed in the hospital, this test measures the rate at which a small amount of injected radioactive material is taken up from the blood by the salivary glands and secreted into the mouth. It is another method to measure salivary flow rate.
    </p>
    <p class = "intro4">Biopsy of minor salivary glands</p>
            <p class = "text3">
                 — A small, shallow incision is made inside the lower lip to remove at least four of these glands. A pathologist then examines them for changes characteristic of the salivary component of Sjögren’s.
            </p>

    <h2>Treating Dry Mouth</h2>

    <p class = "intro4">Reduce oral symptoms and increase salivary secretion</p>
    <p class = "text3">
Two prescription drugs (pilocarpine/Salagen® and cevimeline/Evoxac®) reduce symptoms of dry mouth and increase salivary secretion for a few hours in most patients taking them. Both drugs have side effects; they may not prevent tooth decay and are not suitable for everyone. NeutraSal® is another perscription product that may be used for the relief of dryness of the oral mucosa when dry mouth occurs due to Sjögren's. Consult with your doctor before using these prescription medications. Ask your doctor(s) if any prescription medications you are taking may be contributing to your symptoms of dry mouth. Ask if those that do so can be substituted or discontinued.
    </p>

    <p class = "intro4">Treat and prevent dental decay</p>
    <p class = "text3">
Brush after every meal and floss your teeth daily; use a fluoride-containing toothpaste. When brushing is not possible, chewing gum (containing no sugar) after eating will stimulate saliva and may decrease your risk of tooth decay. It will also help to wash away food debris. At a minimum, rinsing your teeth with water immediately will also help.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
Decrease your risk of tooth decay by decreasing your amount and frequency of fermentable carbohydrate intake, especially sticky foods such as cookies, bread, potato chips and candy.
    </p>

    <p class = "intro4">Ask your dentist</p>
<p class = "text3">
• how frequently you need to be checked for early decay.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
• for specific instructions regarding your oral hygiene.
    </p>
        <p class = "text3">
• about the possible need for homeand/ or professionally-applied topical fluoride (in addition to the fluoride contained in your daily toothpaste). Topical fluoride gels usually require a personalized ‘tray’ for best delivery to your teeth. In some cases, a fluoride varnish may be applied by your dentist.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
• if you should use a remineralizing agent.
    </p>

    <p class = "intro4">Treat oral candidiasis (thrush) when necessary</p>
    <p class = "text3">
A red appearance of the oral mucosa and/or a burning sensation in your mouth may indicate you have an oral infection by the yeast Candida. You should see your dentist or physician to make a definite diagnosis and prescribe an appropriate drug(s). These infections often recur but can be successfully treated as often as necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>Coping with Dry Mouth</h2>
    <p class = "text3">
    Keep your mouth moist by sipping small amounts of water during the day (carry a small water bottle when away from home). However, excessive sips of water can reduce the oral mucus film and increase symptoms.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
Avoid frequent intake of acidic beverages (such as most carbonated and sports replenishment drinks). Drink water while eating to aid chewing and swallowing. Caffeine can increase the sensation of oral dryness; be aware that many soft drinks contain caffeine.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
Salivary secretion can be increased by chewing gum containing no sugar or sucking sugarfree hard candies or a cherry pit. Xylitol is a desirable sweetener present in some chewing gums and hard candies which has been shown to help prevent dental decay.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
Many over-the-counter saliva substitutes are available. Their effects are temporary but helpful to those with very dry mouth. Using a saliva substitute instead of drinking water prior to sleep, and if awakened, prevents excessive urination that causes sleep disruption.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
Dry cracked lips may be soothed by an oil-based balm or lipstick placed over previously moistened lips. The use of vitamin E-containing ointments may be helpful.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
Increase the humidity in your home, particularly at night, by using a room humidifier.
