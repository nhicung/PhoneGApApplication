        <h1>Dry Mouth</h1>
    </div>
         
            <h2>General Information</h2>
        

            <p class = "intro4">

        Dry mouth, usually called ‘xerostomia’ (zeer-oh-stomia), is a common symptom most often caused by a decrease in the amount or quality of saliva. Almost every Sjögren’s patient experiences some degree of dry mouth.
            </p>
            <p class = "intro4">
        Dry mouth has many causes including:
            </p>
            <p class = "text3">
                • prolonged use of many prescription drugs including certain antihistamines, antihypertensives, and antidepressants
        </p>
    <p class = "text3">
        • chronic diseases such as Sjögren’s, sarcoidosis, hepatitis C, diabetes, or depression</p>
        <p class = "text3">
                • medical treatments such as radiation therapy to the head and neck or bone marrow transplantation
            </p>
    
    <h2>About Saliva</h2>
    
            <p class = "text3"> 
              Saliva is an essential body fluid for protection and preservation of the oral cavity and oral functions. It is produced by the three pairs of major salivary glands and hundreds of minor salivary glands. Its value is seldom appreciated until there is not enough. Saliva is mostly water, but it also contains over 60 substances, which:


    </p>
            <p class = "text3">
                • protect, lubricate and cleanse the oral mucosa
    </p>
            <p class = "text3">
                • aid chewing, swallowing and talking
    </p>
            <p class = "text3">
                protect the teeth against decay   
            </p>
     <p class = "text3">
         • protect the mouth, teeth, and throat from infection by bacteria, yeasts, and viruses
    </p>
     <p class = "text3">
        • support and facilitate our sense of taste 
    </p>
    
    <h2> Warning Signs and Symptoms of Dry Mouth</h2>
    <p class = "text3">
    Since saliva plays such an important role in the oral cavity, decreased salivation can lead to many problems. If this condition persists for months or years, a patient may develop oral complications such as difficulty swallowing, severe and progressive tooth decay, oral infections (particularly fungal), or combinations of these.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
As a result, detecting the early signs of dry mouth is critical. The dentist and/or dental hygienist can be instrumental in detecting one of the earliest signs, possibly before the patient is even aware of his or her dry mouth, by observing the amount of saliva pooled under/around the tongue during dental procedures. Little or no pooling of the saliva may indicate the patient is beginning to suffer from dry mouth. Other early signs to look for would be dental decay located at the necks of teeth next to the gums or on the chewing edges of teeth.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
Symptoms of dry mouth can include difficulty swallowing food (especially dry food) without a drink, a change in the sense of taste, a burning sensation or pain in the mouth, difficulty talking or eating certain foods, or some combination of these.
