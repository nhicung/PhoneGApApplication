            <p class = "intro4">

       Look below through the categories for over 100 short but essential survival tips for Sjögren’s patients.
            </p>
        
<p class = "text3">
            • Sjögren’s patients undergoing surgery should talk to their doctor about bringing medications and OTC products that are not commonly stocked in hospital pharmacies.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
 • If you are headed to the hospital, you should inform hospital personnel during the pre-admission visit or phone call about the OTC and prescription medications you need and are bringing.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
 • Consider using a nasal moisturizer before surgery, even if you do not routinely use one. Sjögren’s patients tend to be drier than expected after surgery.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
 • Anticipate experiencing more dryness than usual after surgery. Sjögren’s patients should bring extra eye drops and oral and nasal moisturizers to the hospital.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
 • Tell your surgeon, anesthesiologist and other physicians and staff involved in your hospital care that you have Sjögren’s. Share information about your dryness and other symptoms and routine care.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
 • If you are headed for surgery, ask the nurse to speak with the anesthesiologist to obtain permission for you to take Evoxac® or Salagen® the morning of your surgery if it is part of your routine care.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
 • Before entering the hospital, check out your hospital’s policies. You may be allowed to keep your medications at your bedside, or they may be administered by a nurse. OTC products probably can be kept at your bedside for use as needed.
