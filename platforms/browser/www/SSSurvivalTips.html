       Look below through the categories for over 100 short but essential survival tips for Sjögren’s patients.
            </p>
        
<p class = "text3">
            • To reduce reactions to the sun, wear good UV-protective eye lenses and sunglasses, and seek the shade when outside.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
• Protect your skin and eyes through use of sunscreen, sunglasses, ultraviolet light-protective clothing, hats, and non-fluorescent lighting.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
• Did you know that Sjögren’s patients can react to the sun and other sources of ultraviolet (UV) light? Consider purchasing UV-protective car and home window films that are clear or tinted to protect yourself from UV radiation.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
• Look for the words “broad spectrum” on sunscreen protection. This means that you will be protected from both UVA and UVB radiation.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
• Sjögren’s patients who react to the sun should be especially careful to use sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays. Doctors now recognize the dangers of UVA light in addition to those of UVB.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
• Remember that water, humidity and sweating decrease sunscreen effectiveness and mean you must reapply your sunscreen. Sjögren’s symptoms can be aggravated by sunlight.
    </p>
    <p class = "text3">
• Did you know that ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun and other light sources can affect Sjögren’s patients, leading to skin rashes, disease flares, eye sensitivity and pain? Protect yourself using tips offered by the SSF.
